                Short answer, no as we provide private services. However, if you’re seeking a rebate from Medicare or your private health cover, it is
                best you investigate any requirements prior to self-referring as often these institutions require a specialist referral in order to
                access any rebates.
              </p>

              <p>
                We do recommend referrals are only made after consultation with your doctor or another health professional to assist in identifying
                traits suggestive of a diagnosis. This enables them to complete pre-screening to rule out other potential concerns and ensures that
                this service is appropriate to your needs.

      <h3>Autism Assessments</h3>
      <p>
        Autism assessments are available for children and adults. We recommend referrals are only made after consultation with your doctor or another
        health professional to assist in identifying traits suggestive of an Autism diagnosis.
      </p>

      <p>
        For child clients, a parent/caregiver interview is first conducted, followed by an individual assessment. While the child is with the
        psychologist/assessor, the parent/caregiver will be asked to complete additional assessment tools online if not completed prior.
      </p>

      <p>The cost of $2300 includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Autism assessment (ADOS)</li>
        <li>Clinical interview in line with the ADI-R</li>
        <li>Assessment of function</li>
        <li>A comprehensive diagnostic report</li>
        <li>Additional questionnaires tailored to the client as needed</li>
        <li>A letter with statement of diagnosis</li>
        <li>Feedback session (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Our assessments are completed by Psychologists. NDIS require a consensus team diagnosis for children over 9 and adults to access the scheme.
        This means an additional health professional will need to ratify the diagnosis (e.g. a Paediatrician, Speech Pathologist, Psychiatrist).
        Children accessing NDIS under the Early Childhood Early Intervention (ECEI: under 9 years old) pathway do not require a formal diagnosis for
        initial access, however need to work towards obtaining one in order to stay on the scheme long-term.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Department of Education have different requirements to the NDIS. Sign off from a ‘Lead Practitioner’ such as a Paediatrician or
        Psychiatrist is required.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          *We follow the Autism CRC and meet criteria for participating in diagnosis as part of a consensus team. Whilst we do our best to stay up to
          date with the various institutional requirements, we encourage all clients to ensure that our assessments will meet their needs by checking
          with the relevant institutions (NDIS/Dept. of Ed) and clearly communicating their goals for accessing assessment with us so we can ensure we
          are the right fit*
