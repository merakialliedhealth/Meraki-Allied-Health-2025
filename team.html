          I am a Registered Psychologist and Behaviour Support Practitioner with a passion for working with children and their families. I have worked
          in the disability sector for over eight years, allowing me to gain experience in various different techniques and strategies. I strongly
          believe it takes a village to raise a child and enjoy working with parents, teachers, and caregivers as a unit to support young people.
        </p>

        <p>
          As much as adults use verbal language to communicate, children use play, which is why I aim to ensure all of my sessions are playful and
          adapted to the client’s interests. I believe therapy doesn’t have to be formal to be therapeutic. My areas of interest include Child Centred
          Play Therapy (CCPT), diagnostic assessments, and the Polyvagal Theory.
        </p>

        <p>
          I service Secret Harbour and surrounds, providing NDIS services (Psychology & BSP), play therapy, privately funded services, and assessments
          (ASD & ADHD).

          I am a Registered Psychologist and Behaviour Support Practitioner (Proficient) with a passion for working with children and their families,
          as well as adults. I have worked in the mental health and disability sector for over eight years. My previous role included working with
          adults diagnosed with severe and complex mental health conditions within a person-centred and recovery-oriented model. More recently I have
          worked across the lifespan in both Psychology and Behaviour Support, predominately with children.
        </p>

        <p>
          My areas of interest are diverse and include working with children and adults, providing parent/caregiver support and training, and
          providing Child Centred Play Therapy.
        </p>

        <p>
          I value a human rights and neuro-affirming approach to practice, ensuring interventions are person-centred, strengths based and reflective
          of the person’s values and goals. I service the Eastern suburbs; Forrestfield and surrounds, providing NDIS services (Psychology & PBS),
          CCPT, Medicare services, and privately funded services.
