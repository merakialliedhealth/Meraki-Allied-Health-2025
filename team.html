          I am a Registered Psychologist and Behaviour Support Practitioner with
          a passion for working with children and their families. I have worked
          in the disability sector for over eight years, allowing me to gain
          experience in various different techniques and strategies. I strongly
          believe it takes a village to raise a child and enjoy working with
          parents, teachers, and caregivers as a unit to support young people.
        </p>

        <p>
          As much as adults use verbal language to communicate, children use
          play, which is why I aim to ensure all of my sessions are playful and
          adapted to the client’s interests. I believe therapy doesn’t have to
          be formal to be therapeutic. My areas of interest include Child
          Centred Play Therapy (CCPT), diagnostic assessments, and the Polyvagal
          Theory.
        </p>

        <p>
          I service Secret Harbour and surrounds, providing NDIS services
          (Psychology & BSP), play therapy, privately funded services, and
          assessments (ASD & ADHD).

          working with adults diagnosed with severe and complex mental health
          conditions within a person-centred and recovery-oriented model. More
          recently I have worked across the lifespan in both Psychology and
          Behaviour Support, predominately with children.

        <p>
          My areas of interest are diverse and include working with children and

          I am a proficient level Behaviour Support Practitioner who loves
          working with people of all ages. As a member and parent in the
          neurodivergent community, I am passionate about supporting people with
          disabilities in exercising their right to choice and control in their
          lives. Taking a person-centred approach to therapy, I am committed to
          removing barriers to empowerment by collaborating with the participant
          and their supports. I believe that learning is a two-way street and am
          always open to feedback on how I can improve the experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          My background is in suicide prevention, harm minimisation, and
          sexualised behaviours, having provided support in both the disability
          and mainstream sectors. While safe sexual exploration and protective
          behaviours are my favourite areas to work in, my therapeutic interests
          also include behaviour modelling, internal motivation, reinforcement,
          and mindfulness.

          about working with children and their families, with a particular

          have five years of experience supporting perinatal women and families,

          My therapeutic approach draws on evidence-based modalities including
